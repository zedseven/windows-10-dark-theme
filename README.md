# Windows 10 Dark Mode Activation/Deactivation
Enable/disable dark mode in Windows 10, without having to activate the
software and without needing to find the setting.

You can find two `*.reg` files in this repository. One is for Enabling
dark mode, and the other is for Disabling it (enabling light mode).

## Use
Simply download one or both of the `*.reg` files, and open the one you
want in the Registry Editor.

If you don't trust the files enough to just run them, feel free to open
them up in a text editor and view exactly what they change or even
change your registry keys manually.
