# Windows Registry Tweaks
Tweaks that enable or disable features, without having to activate
the OS and without needing to find the settings.

You can find two `*.reg` files in this repository for each tweak. One
is for Enabling it, and the other is for Disabling it.

## Usage
Simply download the `*.reg` files for the tweaks you want to make, and
open the one you want in the Registry Editor.

If you don't trust the files enough to just run them, feel free to open
them up in a text editor and view exactly what they change or even
change your Registry keys manually.

## Tweaks
### Dark Mode
Enable or disable dark mode in Windows 10.

### Terminal ANSI Colour Code Support By Default
Since the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Windows supports ANSI colour
codes in terminals like Command Prompt and Powershell.

Unfortunately it has to be enabled either by individual apps or by you,
using this Registry key.

### Developer Mode
This allows you to create symbolic links without giving applications
admin privileges, probably among other things.

### Disable Taskbar Notification Flashing
Disable taskbar programs flashing orange when they're trying to get
your attention.
